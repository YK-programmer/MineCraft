# Installation 
This little game is made using python and ursina. Ursina is a very famous game engine for making 3D games, so I decided to use it for my project. 

# About 
This game is a clone of Minecraft. In this game, you can build little structures and also move your player. The graphics are not as good as Minecraft, but the gameplay is similar. If you're looking for a cheaper alternative to Minecraft, this game might be worth checking out.
